# XGBoost

### Project's Title: XGBoost


### Project Description (Problem Statement): 
- Predict [hourly energy consumption](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/robikscube/hourly-energy-consumption?select=PJME_hourly.csv) through time series forecasting using the XGBoost (boosted trees) machine learning algorithm. Finding trends in energy consumption around hours of the day, or much longer trends.

### How to Install and Run the Project:

To successfully run this project you have to do the following steps:

	Step 1. Run the "XGBoost" Jupyter Notebook file on your PC/Notebook.

	Step 2. Import all required libraries and data frames from the Sections "Importing packages" and "Data importing".

	Step 3. Import the dataset. Run the cell of the "Dataset" Section for getting previously mentioned project goals due to Extreme Gradient Boosting Machine Learning model execution (for multiple classification).

	Step 4. Run each cell with Python code within the Jupyter Notebook file sequentially following the instructions. Moreover, get familiar with a theoretical background and comprehensive interpretations of the employed Machine Learning Model to execute the goals of the underlying problem statement.
